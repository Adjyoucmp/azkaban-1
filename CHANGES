Azkaban
=======

Version 0.2.0 (02/07/2014)
--------------------------

Features:

* Separate `azkaban` CLI utility. This allows running workflows on Azkaban,
  and uploading prebuilt archives without having to create an empty project.
* Simpler job options. `Job.get_option` and `Job.get_option_list`
  should allow for easier handling of special job option names.
* Logging is now separate from the output of `Project.main`. It is now
  exclusively meant to be used for debugging.

Breaking changes:

* The `Project.main` method is now deprecated in favor of the `azkaban`
  executable.
* The `--user` and `URL` command line options have been combined into a single
  `--url` option. The new format is '[user@]protocol:endpoint'.
* `Project.merge` is renamed to `Project.merge_into` to be more explicit. Note
  that the direction of the merge has also been reversed.


Version 0.1.0 (10/17/2013)
--------------------------

* Initial release
