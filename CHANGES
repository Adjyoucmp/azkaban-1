Azkaban
=======


Version 0.4.0 (04/10/2014)
--------------------------

* Added project `properties` to set project level default parameters.
* Added `overwrite` option to `Project.add_file` method.

Breaking changes:

* When adding files to a project where a `root` was specified, the default
  archive path will be path relative to the project root. Adding files
  above the project root without specifying an archive path will now raise
  an error.
* Merging projects is now only allowed for projects with the same root.


Version 0.3.0 (02/16/2014)
--------------------------

* Added `azkabanpig` extension. It includes the `PigJob` class and
  a new entry point that allows for easy running of pig scripts.
* Made `--alias` and `--url` options optional (indeed).
* Enabled session refresh after initialization (useful for long running
  jobs, for example with the `azkabanpig` extension).

Breaking changes:

* `~/.azkabanrc` format changed and isn't compatible with the previous
  one. It now allows for specifying custom defaults for some options.
* `Project.main` method is not supported anymore.
* `azkaban list` and `azkaban view` are now combined into `azkaban info`.


Version 0.2.0 (02/07/2014)
--------------------------

Features:

* Separate `azkaban` CLI utility. This allows running workflows on Azkaban,
  and uploading prebuilt archives without having to create an empty project.
* Simpler job options. `Job.get_option` and `Job.get_option_list`
  should allow for easier handling of special job option names.
* Logging is now separate from the output of `Project.main`. It is now
  exclusively meant to be used for debugging.

Breaking changes:

* The `Project.main` method is now deprecated in favor of the `azkaban`
  executable.
* The `--user` and `URL` command line options have been combined into a single
  `--url` option. The new format is '[user@]protocol:endpoint'.
* `Project.merge` is renamed to `Project.merge_into` to be more explicit. Note
  that the direction of the merge has also been reversed.


Version 0.1.0 (10/17/2013)
--------------------------

* Initial release
